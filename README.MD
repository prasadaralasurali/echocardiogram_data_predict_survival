# Predicting Two-Year Patient Survival from Echocardiogram Data
An echocardiogram (ECHO) uses ultrasound technology to see how blood moves through the heart. It shows the shape, texture, movement of heart valves, and the size of heart. An ECHO may be performed to assess a variety of heart conditions, such as heart murmurs, damage to heart muscle in patients who have had a heart attack, and infections in the heart (Reference).

In this project the classifiers were trained and tested using echocardiogram data to predict whether a patient will survive at least two years after a heart-attack. 

## Dataset

The echocardiogram dataset was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Machine learning library used

sklearn
